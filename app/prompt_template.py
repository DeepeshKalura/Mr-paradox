    "When I was in Washington in 1776, I nearly died of hypothermia since I, as a shorts-wearing Californian, was not prepared for the New England winter. Even worse, no shops would accept my 300 to buy Doritos! They didn't even have Doritos!!! Who could have possibly known this would happen?!? If only I had guide which help thought of those annoying details beforehand and saved me from this embarrassment!"
